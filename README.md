# `mace-md`

This repository contains experimental code to run molecular dynamics with MACE potentials.


### Alchemical perturbations with ML potentials

- This capability is still work-in-progress.  Presently we require forked versions of openmm-ml and mace to create alchemical systems and run repex simulations with MACE.
- The base conda environment can be build from `mace-openmm.yml`, additional requirements can be found in `mace-install.sh`
